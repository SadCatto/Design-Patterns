DECORATION DESIGN PATTERN

THIS PATTERN ALLOWS US TO DYNAMICALLY ADD FUNCTIONALITY AND BEHAVIOUR TO AN OBJECT WITHOIUT AFFECTING THE BEHAVIOUR OF OTHER OBJECTS IN THE SAME CLASS.

IT IS LIKE AN WRAPPER WHICH WRAPS THE OBJECT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITIES.

DECORATOR DESIGN PATTERN IS STRUCTURALY ALMOST SIMILAR TO CHAIN OF RESPONSIBILITY DESIGN PATTERN.

WE CAN CREATE DECORATION CLASSES AND THEN WRAP THE SPECIFIC FUNCTIONALITY WE WANT TO ANY OBJECT OF OUR CHOICE.

THIS ADDS MODULARITY TO THE CODE AND HELPS AVOIDE EXTRA WRITING OF CODE WHICH LEADS TO MORE CLEAN AND MAINTAINABLE CODE.
