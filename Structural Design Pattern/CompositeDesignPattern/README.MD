COMPOSITE DESIGN PATTERN

IN THIS DESIGN PATTERN THERE ARE MAJORLY TWO TYPES OF NODES : COMPOSITE AND LEAF

CONPOSITE NODES HAVE CHILDREN BUT LEAF NODES CANNOT HAVE CHILDREN

COMPOSITE PATTERN IS BASICALLY TREE REPRESENTATION OF AN HIERARCHY

EVERY CHILD CAN HAVE ONLY ONE PARENT BUT ONE PARENT CAN HAVE MULTIPLE CHILDREN.

THE COMPOSITE NODE CAN PASS ON ITS TASKS TO THE LEAF NODES FOR EXAMPLE IN AN OFFICE HIERARCHY THERE CAN BE A CEO AT THE TOP THEN GENERAL MANAGERS THEN MANAGERS AND THE THE DEVELOPERS. 

SO THE CEO BASICALLY ASIGNS THE WORK TO GENERAL MANAGERS AND THE  GENERAL MANAGERS TO MANAGERS AND FINALLY TO DEVELOPERS (WHO REPLY WITH ITS NOT A BUG ITS A FEATURE). THE EMPLOYEE BEING THE LEAF NODE HAVE TO DO THE WORK THEMSELVES AS THERE IS NO ONE TO PASS THE WORK TOO.


ANOTHER EXAMPLE CAN BE CONSIDERED AS CALCULATING THE COST OF INDIVIDUAL PART OF CERTAIN PRODUCT
